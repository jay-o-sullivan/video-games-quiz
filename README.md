## UX Design

- I have focused on providing an engaging and intuitive user experience for Controller Chronicles.

    Some of the key design considerations include:

    1. A clear and prominent "Start Quiz" button to encourage users to begin the quiz.
    2. Visual feedback for the timer, showing the time left for each question.
    3. Visual indicators for correct and incorrect answers.
    4. A result popup that displays the user's score and invites them to submit their username for the leaderboard.
    5. A dedicated leaderboard popup with a clean presentation of the top 10 high scores.

### Future Enhancements

     Difficulty Levels: Introduce different difficulty levels for the quiz, such as easy, medium, and hard.
     Sound Effects and Music: Enhance the user experience by adding sound effects for correct and incorrect answers.
     Accessibility: Ensure the quiz is accessible to all users.
     Review Incorrect Answers: Allow players to review their incorrect answers after completing the quiz for a learning experience.
     Randomized Questions: Randomize the order of questions to ensure a unique experience for each quiz attempt.
